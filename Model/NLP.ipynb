If they are talking by the age of 3 years and do not have difficulty in learning, the child may be labelled to have Asperger’s, while others with delayed language milestones and impaired learning would end up on the severe end of spectrum. The earlier DSM IV criteria suggested the following sub-classification of autism; however, the recent DSM-5 has merged these and assimilated them under the umbrella term of ASD\n",
    "Even though ASD can be diagnosed as early as age 2 years, most children are not diagnosed with ASD until after age 4 years. The median age of first diagnosis by subtype is as follows : • Autistic disorder : 3 years 10 months • Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS): 4 years 1 month • Asperger disorder : 6 years 2 months Studies have shown that parents of children with ASD notice a developmental problem before their child’s first birthday. Concerns about vision and hearing were more often reported in the first year, and differences in social, communication, and fine motor skills were evident from 6 months of age. And further research has shown that if intervened early, these children may be able to overcome some of their socio-behavioral handicaps. Hence, currently there is an endeavor to identify these children “at risk” early i.e., within first one to two years of life and introduce therapeutic interventions. This involves educating the parents about the red flags and also train the physicians to specifically ask and check for specific symptoms/ signs. This identification of autism spectrum disorders at an age of one to two years is referred to as “early identification” of autism\n",
    "Autism has an onset at an early age usually infancy, but it may go unnoticed because the signs are very subtle and non-specific. The important early cues that may aid diagnosis of autism include: Figure 1: Classification of ASD 41 Infancy (a) Infant not responding to cuddliness (b) Infant shying away from being picked up and held (c) Failure to make eye contact or look at people - especially at parents – when they are talking to them or interacting with them. (d) Failure to look at or acknowledge a toy or item when it is shown to them. Toddlers (e) Toddlers not engaging in imaginative play. Rather than pretending with their toys or other children, they may meticulously line up dolls, cars, and other items and become upset when someone disturbs the line. (f) Toddlers have difficulties sharing their toys/ items (g) Toddlers may not express any interest in a particular item even if that toy or doll is their favorite (h) As toddlers, thay may become fixated on specific objects or details of the objects, which may range from certain toys, certain items of clothing, or even the way sunlight hits the leaves outside the window.

Hyper- or hypo- reactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/ temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movements) C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifested until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life). D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of current functioning. E. These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make co-morbid diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level\n",
