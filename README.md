# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection
## Early Prediction of Autism Disorder
## Domain: Health Tech

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a diverse group of conditions. They are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Typical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations. Steps:

### Define:
1. The problem can be defined as the need for efficient and accurate methods of early detection to identify signs of autism in early childhood.
2. The problem at hand is the delayed recognition and diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) despite its prevalence, affecting many childrens at the early stage
### Measure :
1. Net Worth:The global autism spectrum disorders market was valued at $27.3 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $43.2 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2022 to 2031 according to AlliedMarketResearch.
2. The prevalence of ASD: According to a report by ETHealthWorld, about 18 million people in India are diagnosed with autism. About 1 to 1.5 percent of children aged two to nine years are diagnosed with ASD.
### Analyze :
1. Complex nature of ASD: Ambiguity in deciding the correct name for the disease that the patient is facing due to wide range of symptoms.
2. Comprehensive Assessment: Implement a multi-modal assessment approach that considers a range of behavioral and physical factors. This can help in characterizing the condition more accurately

To solve the problem of early autism detection, a comprehensive approach that combines various elements, including data, technology, awareness, and collaboration, is required. Here's a detailed description of how this problem can be addressed:

● Data Collection and Preparation: This step focuses on assembling a diverse dataset of children's images, labeling and adding metadata, and standardizing image sizes and quality.

● Machine Learning Model Development: It involves the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python and relevant libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, and Pandas for classifying images to distinguish children with ASD from those without.

● Data Augmentation and Preprocessing: The dataset is enhanced using data augmentation techniques, ensuring diversity and preventing overfitting. Images are preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and center-cropping for uniformity.

● Natural Language Processing (NLP) Component: NLP is integrated to allow users to ask questions and receive informative responses within the web application, supported by a knowledge base. ● Streamlit Web Application: A user-friendly web application is created using Streamlit to facilitate interaction with the model. It includes an intuitive interface for uploading images and receiving predictions.
